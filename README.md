Harmonia 

## Introduction 

"Harmonia" is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible website promoting chemical free gardening and services available locally. The name Harmonia is actually co-pilot inspired.

The live project can be found here: <a href="https://pio-o-connell.github.io/Individual/">Harmonia</a>

## Project Outline

### External User’s Goal: 
The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on the benefits of eco-friendly gardening practices and behaviours . 

### Site Owner’s Goal: 
The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides infomation on ecofriendly gardening using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.


### Key Objectives

- Design and implement an interactive front-end web application using HTML and CSS based on user experience design principles, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- Test and validate the web application through the development, implementation, and deployment stages.
- Deploy the one-page web application to a cloud platform.
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure, and organisation.
- Leverage AI tools to orchestrate the software development process.

## Colors
There is a lot of colours in a garden already so I used a simple background #E9D98A , one colour for all text    --primary-color: #3a2620;  a CTA of    --secondary-color: #506D1B ; and the use of whitespace where appropiate. I used image picker website to choose a colour scheme  https://imagecolorpicker.com/

The image is 
![alt text](image.png)

Other colours taken from the image suggested include -

#506D1B works well for buttons or header text for contrast.
#C9B66B can highlight elements like links or hover effects.
#E6E2D3 is perfect for background areas or cards.


- Title and subtitles: '#4D4D4D'
- Body text: '#4D4D4D'
- Header and footer: '#4D4D4D';
- Background: '#E9D98A'
- Primary button: '#4D4D4D'
- Secondary button: '#506D1B;
- Links: '#4D4D4D'

## Fonts

Similar to colour, the font should be easy to read. Three different fonts were needed; titles, body, and quotes. These were implemnted through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.


/* Google fonts import */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Macondo&display=swap');

[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was used everywhere.

## Imagery

I wanted to convey a garden well maintained is a beautiful open space.  Therfore I have a carousel effect on the main page features images from a garden that I do maintain. It is hoped that this is the main focus of attention. Evrything else is minimised fonts ,colours . There would be a lot more colour again in the summertime,

For the background images on cards I simply use youtube frampicker option. It needed to be actual real pictures.

## Features

### General Features

#### Navigation and Carousel Section

I decided to use images of a garden I maintain  to convey my message about beautiful open spaces. This section features a  CTA button that then opens to maintenance services available.

The navigation bar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation around the site using a familiar method for a positive user experience.

#### Bootstrap Cards

Bootstrap cards were used for the services section, to layout quick actionable tips. Each card has a linkto extra resources.

![Bootstrap Cards](assets/documentation/images/Bootstrap%20cards/bootstrapcards.jpg )

#### Footer

For the footer I used bootstrap utilities so that it sticks to the bottom of the page. The footer includes contact information as well as links to social media platforms and the privacy agreement.

#### Links and Buttons

Buttons were customised to their specific role and page layout. This is so that they stand out from their backgrounds and provide uniform function based on design. This was implemnted by customising the btn-primary and btn-secondary bootsrap classes.

#### Future development

With more time I would create the additional resources page and link it to the appropriate buttons. This page would go into more details about how to manage stress, with embeded videos to provide user interaction.

## Deployment

This [GitHub](https://github.com/) project was created using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) ensuring all necessary dependencies were included when opening within the designated workspace on the [Gitopod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Setup a repo using this method and template:
1. Login to your GitHub profile.
2. Navigate to the Code Institute Full Template
3. Click the dropdown for 'Use this template' and select "Create a new repository"
4. Generate the necessary name and description for your repo and click 'Create repository from template'
5. Navigate to the new repo and click the green 'Open' button with the Gitpod logo<br>
**IMPORTANT - This button should only be clicked once to generate the new IDE workspace**
6. You can now work on your repository within the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace

Once the project repo is created, an early deployment for the live project should performed.<br>
This allows for early and continuous testing using a variety of devices, as well as the Dev Tools available within browsers.

Additional information on the deployment process can be found on the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
