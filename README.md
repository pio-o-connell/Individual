Harmonia 

## Introduction 

"Harmonia" is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible website promoting chemical free gardening and services available locally.

## Project Outline

### External User’s Goal: 
The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on the benefits of eco-friendly gardening practices and behaviours . 

### Site Owner’s Goal: 
The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides infomation on ecofriendly gardening using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.


### Key Objectives

- Design and implement an interactive front-end web application using HTML and CSS based on user experience design principles, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- Test and validate the web application through the development, implementation, and deployment stages.
- Deploy the one-page web application to a cloud platform.
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure, and organisation.
- Leverage AI tools to orchestrate the software development process.

## Colors
There is a lot of colours in a garden already so I used a simple background #E9D98A , one colour for all text #4D4D4D and the use of whitespace where appropiate. I used image picker website to choose a colour scheme  https://imagecolorpicker.com/

The image is 
![alt text](image.png)

Other colours taken from the image suggested include -

#506D1B works well for buttons or header text for contrast.
#C9B66B can highlight elements like links or hover effects.
#E6E2D3 is perfect for background areas or cards.


- Title and subtitles: '#4D4D4D'
- Body text: '#4D4D4D'
- Header and footer: '#4D4D4D';
- Background: '#E9D98A'
- Primary button: '#4D4D4D'
- Secondary button: '#4D4D4D'
- Links: '#4D4D4D'

## Fonts

Similar to colour, the font should be easy to read. Three different fonts were needed; titles, body, and quotes. These were implemnted through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.


/* Google fonts import */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Macondo&display=swap');

[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was used everywhere.
