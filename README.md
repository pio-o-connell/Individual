Harmonia 

## Introduction 

"Harmonia" is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible website promoting chemical free gardening and services available locally. The name Harmonia is actually co-pilot inspired.

The live project can be found here: <a href="https://pio-o-connell.github.io/Individual/">Harmonia</a>

## Colors
There is a lot of colours in a garden already so I used a simple background #E9D98A , one colour for all text #4D4D4D and the use of whitespace where appropiate. I used image picker website to choose a colour scheme  https://imagecolorpicker.com/

The image is 
![alt text](image.png)

Other colours taken from the image suggested include -

#506D1B works well for buttons or header text for contrast.
#C9B66B can highlight elements like links or hover effects.
#E6E2D3 is perfect for background areas or cards.


- Title and subtitles: '#4D4D4D'
- Body text: '#4D4D4D'
- Header and footer: '#4D4D4D';
- Background: '#E9D98A'
- Primary button: '#4D4D4D'
- Secondary button: '#4D4D4D'
- Links: '#4D4D4D'

## Fonts

Similar to colour, the font should be easy to read. Three different fonts were needed; titles, body, and quotes. These were implemnted through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) using a direct import code within the style.css file.


/* Google fonts import */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Macondo&display=swap');

[Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) was used everywhere.

## Imagery

I wanted to convey a garden well maintained is a beautiful open space.  Therfore I have a carousel effect on the main page features images from a garden that I do maintain. It is hoped that this is the main focus of attention. Evrything else is minimised fonts ,colours . There would be a lot more colour again in the summertime,

For the background images on cards I simply use youtube frampicker option. It needed to be actual real pictures.

## Features

### General Features

#### Navigation and Carousel Section

I decided to use images of a garden I maintain for an elderly neighbour to convey my message about beautiful open spaces. This section features a  CTA button that then opens to maintenance services available.

The navigation bar is a Bootstrap component that allows for easy navigation around the site using a familiar method for a positive user experience.
